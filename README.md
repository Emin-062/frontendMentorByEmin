## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- CSS Grid  
- Mobile-first workflow  
- JavaScript for interactive menu toggling  

### What I learned

This project was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox by experimenting with named grid areas and flexible layouts. Initially, I combined Flexbox and Grid in the `.hero` section, but later refined it to rely solely on CSS Grid for cleaner and more maintainable code.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was managing the responsive navigation menu — especially handling the transition between mobile and desktop views seamlessly. I discovered how powerful `!important` can be in CSS to override styles quickly; however, I also realized its potential pitfalls. Through careful debugging and logical use of JavaScript event listeners and window resize handlers, I crafted a solution that keeps the menu behavior intuitive without forcing page reloads.

I also improved my skills in managing media queries to create a smooth, mobile-first responsive experience, ensuring that the site looks great and functions perfectly on all screen sizes.

Finally, I gained hands-on experience with accessible navigation practices and semantic HTML, making sure interactive elements have clear hover and focus states to enhance usability.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to:

- Continue refining my CSS Grid and Flexbox expertise, aiming for even more elegant and efficient layouts.  
- Explore advanced JavaScript techniques to enhance interactivity without sacrificing performance.  
- Learn more about accessibility standards to build inclusive web experiences.  
- Improve image optimization and adopt modern HTML5 elements like `<picture>` for responsive images.
